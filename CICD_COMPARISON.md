# CI/CD Platform Decision Guide

## Azure DevOps vs GitHub Actions

Both platforms can automate your Terraform + Ansible deployment. Here's how to choose:

---

## **Use Azure DevOps If:**

### Corporate Standards
- âœ… HUB International already uses Azure DevOps
- âœ… IT department mandates Azure DevOps for compliance
- âœ… Need integration with Azure Boards (project management)

### Technical Requirements
- âœ… Want native Azure service principal integration
- âœ… Need advanced approval workflows (multi-stage approvals)
- âœ… Require artifact retention policies
- âœ… Want visual pipeline editor (YAML or classic)

### Team Preferences
- âœ… Team already familiar with Azure DevOps
- âœ… Want tighter Azure RBAC integration
- âœ… Need private artifact feeds (Azure Artifacts)

---

## **Use GitHub Actions If:**

### Simplicity
- âœ… Want simpler YAML syntax
- âœ… Faster to set up (fewer steps)
- âœ… Better documentation and community support

### GitHub Integration
- âœ… Code already in GitHub
- âœ… Want GitHub Issues/PR integration
- âœ… Team prefers GitHub workflow

### Flexibility
- âœ… Larger marketplace of pre-built actions
- âœ… Better for multi-cloud (not just Azure)
- âœ… Easier for personal/side projects

## **My Recommendation for This Project**

### **Start with Azure DevOps** âœ…

**Why?**
1. You're 100% Azure-focused
2. Better enterprise governance (HUB likely uses it)
3. Native service connection = fewer authentication issues
4. Better audit trails for compliance

### **Also Create GitHub Actions**

**Why?**
1. Provides backup/alternative
2. Useful if Azure DevOps has issues
3. Good for sharing outside organization
4. Learn both platforms

---

## **What I've Created**

### âœ… **azure-pipelines.yml** 
- 4-stage pipeline (Terraform â†’ Wait â†’ Ansible â†’ Destroy)
- Uses Azure service connections
- Dynamic inventory generation
- Full verification steps

### ðŸš§ **GitHub Actions workflow** (next)
- Will create: `.github/workflows/deploy-vm.yml`
- Similar functionality
- Uses GitHub secrets instead of Azure DevOps variable groups

---

## **Cost Comparison**

Both are free for your use case:

**Azure DevOps:**
- Free: 1,800 pipeline minutes/month (Microsoft-hosted agents)
- Free: Unlimited self-hosted agents

**GitHub Actions:**
- Free: 2,000 minutes/month (public repos)
- Free: 3,000 minutes/month (GitHub Pro)
- Enterprise pricing for private repos at scale

---

## **Quick Setup Checklist**

### Azure DevOps (Current)
- [ ] Access to Azure DevOps organization
- [ ] Create project
- [ ] Push code to Azure Repos
- [ ] Create service connection
- [ ] Create variable group with secrets
- [ ] Run pipeline

### GitHub Actions (Next)
- [ ] Code in GitHub repository
- [ ] Add secrets to repository settings
- [ ] Configure Azure credentials
- [ ] Push workflow file
- [ ] Trigger workflow

---

## **Migration Path**

You can switch between them easily:

**Azure DevOps â†’ GitHub Actions:**
1. Move secrets from variable group to GitHub secrets
2. Replace service connection with GitHub Azure login
3. Push workflow file to `.github/workflows/`

**GitHub Actions â†’ Azure DevOps:**
1. Move secrets from GitHub to Azure DevOps variable group
2. Replace GitHub secrets with variable group references
3. Use service connection instead of az login action

**Ready to proceed with Azure DevOps setup, or would you like me to create the GitHub Actions workflow first?**
